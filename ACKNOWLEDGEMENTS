MIAMI includes code developed at Rice University as part of the HPCToolkit 
and DSystem frameworks. In particular, the Tarjan interval analysis
and the Java XML viewer were taken from HPCToolkit.
A collection of basic graph classes were taken from an early release 
of the OpenAnalysis library.

An initial implmentation based on analysis of Sparc binaries using the EEL
binary analysis framework has been developped at Rice University before 2008. 
The current implementation based on analysis of x86 binaries has been under
development since 2011. Some functionality could be ported over from the
Sparc version, however, a majority of the code is completely new, or heavily
modified.
