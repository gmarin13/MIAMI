Description of data reuse metrics:

Reuse_L1D : Long reused locations for level L1D
IrregReuse_L1D : Irregular long reused locations for level L1D
Reuse_L2D : Long reused locations for level L2D
IrregReuse_L2D : Irregular long reused locations for level L2D
Reuse_L3D : Long reused locations for level L3D

 - lists individual memory access patterns grouped by source and destination
   of the reuse, and their contribution to misses at various memory levels.
   "IrregReuse_*" accounts only for misses caused by patterns that were
   determined to be irregular or indirect, while "Reuse_*" accounts for
   misses from all memory access patterns.

   For each pattern group you can further see the carrying scopes of
   individual access patterns and how many misses each pattern produces.
   See my ISPASS'08 paper for an explanation of data access patterns, and
   definition of source, destination, carrier scopes.
